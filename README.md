# Social Media Aggregator 

## Overview

With the amount of social media platforms that are available to users today, it's not uncommon for people to have multiple social media accounts for each platform. It 
can be hard to keep up with all your friends' social media presences without having to scroll through each platform. This is where Social Media Aggregator (not final name) comes in. 

Social media aggregator will have your friends' social media accounts all in one place. Users can register by providing a username for the web application and all their handles for their social media accounts. Once registered, they can login and choose to follow other people who are registered to Social Media Aggregator and can see all their associated recent posts for their social media handles. This web app will focus on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
